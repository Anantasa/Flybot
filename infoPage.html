	<p>
	FlyBot was created in order for people to have quick access to the cheapest and highest quality flights out there based on your current location and where you want to go.
	It is a chatbot that you can communicate with whenever you want.
	The tools required to create this project were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery, ajax.
	The API's used to create this were Google Places to find the nearest commercial airport and the QP express to find out which planes were flying.
	I hope that I get a chance to update this and make this even stronger in the future, and to be open to the public.
